      '  Okay, maybe a Roman god wouldn&rsquo;t have used a level app on a smart phone. Maybe he could just put his hands on a surface and feel even the\n' +
      '  smallest tilt. I mean, he was a god, right? So what makes this level app so useful that it bears the name of a Roman god?\n' +

      '  Yeah, there are a lot of carpenter&rsquo;s level apps out there. And while most smart phones have a gravity sensor, most of them aren&rsquo;t\n' +
      '  installed with precision, so most of these apps aren&rsquo;t very accurate unless you can calibrate them. A lot of smart-phone levels have a\n' +
      '  &ldquo;Calibrate&rdquo; button, but you first need to put your device on a surface that you already know is level. And to know that, you need a\n' +

      '  So how useful is that? Well, not very. So your level&rsquo;s calibration button probably doesn&rsquo;t do you much good.\n' +

      '  Here&rsquo;s where Vulcan&rsquo;s Level beats all the other smart-phone levels: It uses a unique two-stage calibration process. By measuring a surface\n' +
      '  from two different orientations, it can compensate for a tilted surface. So it can give you a true calibration, even from a surface that&rsquo;s\n' +
      '  not truly level. Kind of like putting your hands on a surface and just feeling even the smallest tilt. How does that work? Well, download\n' +
      '  the app and try it yourself.\n' +
